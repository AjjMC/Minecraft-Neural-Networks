## Overview

Neural Networks is a map with interactive AI systems for reading handwritten digits and letters drawn on a canvas. This is achieved using AI models trained IRL on image classification, which were engineered for use in the game.

## Demo

- The hotbar contains tools for interacting with the canvas.
- Outputs are shown as characters are being drawn.
- There are three AI models available in the settings.
